This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Timer Clock 25 + 5

I developed this project at the request of FreeCodeCamp to implement my knowledge of using libraries, in my case React and Sass.

The functionality of my project is very similar to that of a Pomodoro Timer.

I developed it using reactjs and styled it using sass. Among other external sources like Font Awsome to get the icons.

If you want you can see a [demo](https://luismgil.github.io/timer-clock).
